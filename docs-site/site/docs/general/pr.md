## PR guidance
Keep PRs small and focused.

Always pull the latest main before creating a branch.

Run pre-commit hooks locally before committing, this can be automated as outlined in [the development page](development.md).

Ensure that all functionality is tested before merging.

## How to PR review
- When reviewing a PR, follow these steps:

- Check the purpose of the PR

- Confirm that it addresses a specific task or issue.

- Look for adherence to coding standards (formatting, naming, structure).

- Verify that the code works as intended.

- Check for potential issues

- Look for merge conflicts, duplicate code, or broken functionality.

- Ensure that changes are modular and don’t introduce unnecessary dependencies.

- Comment constructively

- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.

- Suggest improvements politely.
